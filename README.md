# FSQRT_BFLOAT16
This is the repository for the Embedded Systems project 2019/20. The aim is to design an hardware unit able to compute the square root of a number given in BFloat16 representation standard by applying a variant of the Goldschmidt algorithm for the division.

The repository is organized as follows:
* RTL: is the folder that contains all the SystemVerilog files but the testbench one.
* tb: is the folder that contains the resources for the testing of the module.
* Sqrt_Project.pdf: is the pdf file that contains all the documentation about the project.
